First, double-click the file named "post_template.sh".

You will be prompted to write down:

1. A title (this will be the title of your post)
2. Your categories (this can be anything from 'methods' to 'new findings')
3. Your tags (e.g. PROT, ROS, DNA, etc.)

Your page will then look like this:

---  
layout: post  
title: 'your title here'  
date: '2024-04-10'  
categories: 'your categories here'  
tags: 'your tags here'  
---  

*note: you can use "---" to make a line break*  

Your notebook entry will come after this section.  
To add spacing between lines, you can either have an empty line on both sides of the sentence, or just add a double-space at the end/beginning  
There are several different ways to add flair to your entry:  
* = bulletpoint  
1. 1.(with a space), 2., 3., = numbered list/bulletpoint
2. just some text
3. and some more text

```placing text between three apostrophes changes its appearance```


# = Big Title using "#"
## = Subtitle using "##"
**bolded text within double asterisks ("**")**  
*italicized text within single asterisks("*")*
