Protocol for the preservation of animal tissues for RNA and DNA extraction in the absence of liquid nitrogen and -80 freezers (i.e., remote field collection protocol)  

# Necessities  

## Reagents  
  
* [RNA/DNA Shield](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r1100-50_r1100-250_r1200-25_r1100-125_dna_rna_shield.pdf)
* Ethanol 100%
* Bleach 10%
* DI water

## Equipment

* [Stainless steel bone cutters/nail clippers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QLZAZT4/ref=crt_ewc_img_dp_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A1TAB9STHMJYHV)
* [Stainless steel forceps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EKQ7FZI/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER)
* [Ethanol Burner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BJW6S/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A37SSOMGWCKVU1)
* [Sterile DNase RNase free microfugue tubes 2.0ml with o-ring, e.g., VWR Cat #; 89004-310](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4674084/vwr-screw-cap-microcentrifuge-tubes)

* Plastic Beakers/Cups
* Lighter or matches

## RNALater Guidelines
[RNA/DNA Shield](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r1100-50_r1100-250_r1200-25_r1100-125_dna_rna_shield.pdf)  

* Use RNA/DNA Sheild Solution with fresh tissue only; do not freeze tissues before immersion in RNAlater Solution. 
* Before immersion in Solution, cut large tissue samples to 
≤0.5 cm in any single dimension. 
* Place the fresh tissue in shield following manufacturer's instructions. 



# Sample Collection  

## Tool Sterilzation
* Make 10% bleach solution in DI water in plastic beaker labeled ```#1 10% Bleach```
* Pour 100% DI water in plastic beaker labeled ```#2 DI Water```
* Pour 100% Ethanol soluion in plastic beaker labeled ```#3 100% Ethanol```
* Line up Beakers 1, 2, and 3 next to the ethanol burner filled with 100% ethanol

* First, dip the clippers and forceps in ```#1 10% Bleach```
* Second, rinse clippers and forceps in ```#2 DI Water```
* Third, rinse the clippers and forceps in ```#3 100% Ethanol```
* Fourth, sterilze tools by burning off the ethanol 
* Fifth, place tools upside down in tube rack with sterile end up

## Glove Cleaning
* Make a 5 gallon bucket with 10% bleach
* Make a 5 gallon bucket with fresh water 
* Dunk gloved hands in 10% bleach and then fresh water bucket between each sample

## Sample Collection

* Fill each tube with desired volume of RNA DNA Shielf solution
* Pick up sample with clean glove
* Cut tissue section ≤0.5 cm in any single dimension
* Place tissue section in prelabeled 2ml tube with Shield solution
* Repeat sample collection process for a duplicate tube for every sample as possible

## Sample Preservation

* Store and/or transport samples as follows in DNA/RNA Shield for later purification of high-quality DNA and/or RNA
